;; To-Do Stack
;;
;; This is a specialized to-do list tailored to how my mind works.
;; It is implemented as a stack, so that new ideas go to the top, and
;; push other ones down. Slight breaking of a true stack is possible,
;; through the "cycle" and "pull" commands.
;;
;; The program runs and terminates in small bursts, and does not contain
;; a persistent daemon. Data is stored in files in the *ROOT* directory.
;; *ROOT*/list contains the stack itself, a list of symbols representing
;; filenames. The files contain PRINT-ed Lisp data representing todo-item
;; instances.

;; This program is written according to the UNIX philosophy. It works
;; with text streams, and should easily be integrated into other
;; programs.
